Toasty!
A game framework for Marmalade SDK.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.12.2011
It's been a month since it started and there's only a few steps left to be tested completely. A Nice test project. Stay tuned!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Toasty! Game Framework for Marmalade SDK is intended to be a group of classes, interfaces and patterns to allow you focus directly on the design and development of your game.

Read CHANGES.txt for a day by day change list.

Examples of use are found in the 'examples' folder.

Development tests units can be found inside the 'tests' folder and might work as examples of use for specific functionality.

Source files are mostly doc-commentated and (thanks to Doxygen) a documentation can be found in the docs folder (html and latex).

Have as much fun using it just as I have making it!

Bests,
Leandro 'Grün' Ostera
