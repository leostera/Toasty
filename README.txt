Toasty!
A game framework for Marmalade SDK.

The Toasty! Game Framework for Marmalade SDK is intended to be a group of classes, interfaces and patterns to allow you focus directly on the design and development of your game.

Read CHANGES.txt for a day by day change list.

Examples of use are found in the 'examples' folder.

Development tests can be found inside the 'tests' folder and might work as examples of use for specific functionality.

Source code is mostly documentated with comments but a doxygen/similar documentation will be released as soon as the framework is up and running.

Have as much fun using it just as I have making it!

Bests,
Leandro 'Grün' Ostera
