Toasty!
a Marmalade SDK game framework

Autor: Leandro 'The Phantom Lord' / 'Grün' Ostera

Notes (07.20.2011): Project started on 07.12.2011 as I've seen that the current Marmalade game framework lacked the ease of use needed for RAD and prototyping. It actually started as just a sprite class and then, as I was developing a game, decided that some base classes and utilities would be helpful to speed up development. As it is said, the lone developer must work not hard, but smart.




WISHLIST (08.12.2011)

system:
	string input
	scripting language (python?)
	file compressor / decompressor

game/actors:
	paths, and path following

gfx/sprites:
	resizing
	effects (colorize, antialias, etc) - not to be used frequently

gfx/gui:
	really really simple and fast 1-2-3 gui model
	button
	slider
	checkbox

gfx/particlesystem: //might use pharticle as base
	emitters, changers, destroyers
	particlesystems using sprites
	as particles are 'actors', paths and physics

sfx:
	loader (mp3, etcetera, might use tune4airplay!)
	simple effects (chorus, reverb, phase*-1, distort)
	renderer
	positional sound
	audio streaming from disk with ringbufferes (for large music files)
	midi support
