8.14.2011
+ Input Singleton now working for imput with some simple methods. For now that's all I need, and I'm quite happy (dispite it's quite late and I haven't got Gestures working YET...but I'm willing to, soon)

8.11.2011
+ Finally, I've started the Input class singleton (although it's not implemented as so) I'll start doing better CHANGES LOG UPDATES as soon as I can.

8.10.2011
+ 5 days go by and Actors, Scene and SceneManager are working nice. Still, Scene needs a bit of a tweak and addition in the Play() method. Will go back to it soon. Documentation soon!

+ Actors working smooth and nice! Also, TyActor is now documentated (a bit at least).

8.4.2011
+ Added Flip, Rotate and Center functionality to the TySprite class. Works as hell!

8.2.2011
